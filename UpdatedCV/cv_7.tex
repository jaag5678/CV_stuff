\section{Current- PhD Computer Science}

    Shared memory semantics, also known as memory consistency models, specify how a concurrent program behaves. 
    While sequential interleaving is considered as the de-facto way of reasoning with such programs, current hardware as well as software drift away from it significantly.
    Semantics for them are termed as weak consistency models, allowing for more concurrent behaviors that result due to optimizations mainly understood as those done by hardware.
    %signifying they allow behaviors that go beyond sequential reasoning.
    While hardware models reflect desired optimizations, the same cannot be said for software models.
    Software (compiler) optimizations have historically been designed for sequential programs, and thus, optimization choices sometimes interact badly with concurrent software.
    This has resulted in software exhibiting unexpected concurrent behaviors, which makes software correctness a hard task to address. 
    Existing solutions to this are too complex to be feasible in practice. 
    They tend to either make code development difficult or limit the range of potential optimizations. 
    This results in a trade-off between performance, as enabled by aggressive optimization, and the ability to ensure correctness of the optimized piece of software. 
    %Weaker memory models do not allow \textit{more} compiler optimizations (transformations); seemingly harmless syntactic changes may also be unsafe.
    %However, this \textit{`more'} may not be strict.
    %Surprisingly, the implications of these memory models on the safety of compiler optimizations is unclear. 
    %To add, existing semantics for programming language memory models allow unexpected behaviors of programs.
    %Previous work shows that attempting to allow as many compiler optimizations as possible leads to more unexpected behaviors, the vice versa being disallowing unexpected behaviors inhibits us from doing potentially performance critical optimizations.
    The goal of this PhD is to unveil a precise and practically useful correlation between memory consistency models and compiler optimizations. In this endeavor, we propose a new design methodology of memory models for software, one that places emphasis on the compiler optimizations desired to be performed. 
    We intend to establish a system of formally constructing models that allow compilers to also do much of the performance-giving optimizations, without sacrificing correct functioning of software. 
    %We believe this framework of designing memory consistency models is more friendly to compiler developers and also help in designing safe optimizations for a target memory model.
